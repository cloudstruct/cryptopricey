# CloudStruct CryptoPricey
A Free Slack and/or Discord bot from which you can schedule or request price announcements from.
CryptoPricey was created as a learning project but also because there did not seem to be any free simple solutions fitting the bill.  

## Installation
CryptoPricey is available as a standard Slack App from the Slack App Store.

You do not need to download, run, install, or host this project.  We host it for everyone.

## Usage

### To configure recurring scheduled price announcements
